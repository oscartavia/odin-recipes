## About this project

The [**Odin Recipes project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is part of The Odin Project Foundations course. The purpose of this project is to strengthen basic HTML concepts like boilerplate format, elements (headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists and anchors) and the correct use of references for images and hyperlinks.
